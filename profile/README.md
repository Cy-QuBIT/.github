### 🧪 Research

The **Cy-QuBIT Lab** conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of quantum computing, cybersecurity, and machine learning. Current research themes include: 

> #### 📊 Machine Learning for Stress Detection and Prediction  
We explore stress prediction in older adults using behavioral time-series sensor data (electrodermal activity, blood volume pulse, skin temperature) combined with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. This work investigates relationships between multi-modal sensor inputs and cortisol biomarkers to forecast stress levels proactively.

> #### 🔍 Quantum Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection  
This research applies quantum-hybrid machine learning techniques — including quantum-enhanced support vector machines — to detect anomalies in cyber-physical system data. Early results show improvements over classical methods in identifying cyber-attack signatures in high-dimensional datasets.

> #### ⚙️ Secure FPGA Design with MTJ/CMOS  
Focusing on hardware security, work is underway to design low-power, CPA-resistant configurable logic blocks (CLBs) by integrating magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices with CMOS. These CLBs target secure, energy-efficient FPGA architectures suitable for IoT and embedded applications.

> #### 🔐 Crosstalk Attack Resilient Quantum Addition  
As quantum computing systems scale, shared environments introduce new security risks. This project investigates quantum crosstalk attacks on ion-trap qubits and proposes resilient quantum addition techniques using residue number systems to mitigate such threats.

> #### ⚡ Energy-Efficient STT-MRAM Writing Circuitry  
Research develops novel designs for energy-efficient write circuits for spin transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM). By combining sinusoidal power clocking with efficient control logic, these circuits show significant energy savings over traditional designs.

? #### 🛠️ Automated Generation of Dual Rail Adiabatic Gates  
This project focuses on secure adiabatic circuit synthesis using binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to create dual-rail adiabatic logic, which offers improved resistance to side-channel attacks like differential power analysis.

> #### 🤖 Quantum Machine Learning for Consumer Electronics  
Exploring quantum machine learning methodologies for anomaly detection in consumer electronics systems, this effort highlights frameworks and case studies demonstrating QML’s potential in cybersecurity and threat detection tasks.
